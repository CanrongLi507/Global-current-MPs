>This chapter lists three machine learning models: the BP neural network model based on the Keras framework, the DNN deep learning regression algorithm based on neural networks, and the RF random forest ensemble algorithm. 
>These models are used to predict the abundance of microplastics in global seabed sediments. 
>All three models use data from 155 sampling points and 75 valid literature data points as the training set for predicting global microplastic abundance, with other global grid latitude and longitude data and remote sensing data serving as the test set.
