# Sea surface data extraction

Based on the latitude and longitude of 155 sediment sampling points across 12 different marine areas, along with the dates, we downloaded the remote sensing dataset of ocean surface currents corresponding to the sampling dates

# Overview

Navigate to the folder concerning the six sea surface remote sensing data sets discussed in this section. There, you will find various steps on how to extract the required sea surface remote sensing data based on the latitude and longitude of sampling points and the sampling dates. The annotations for each Python file are explained as follows:
- `Extract_data_uo.py` - Eastward sea water velocity at the sampling point was extracted
- `Extract_data_vo.py` - Northward sea water velocity at the sampling point was extracted
- `Extract_data_VHM0.py` - Sea surface wave significant height at the sampling point was extracted
- `Extract_data_VMDR.py` - Sea surface wave from direction at the sampling point was extracted
- `Extract_data_VSDX.py` - Sea surface wave stokes drift X velocity at the sampling point was extracted
- `Extract_data_VSDY.py` - Sea surface wave stokes drift Y velocity at the sampling point was extracted
